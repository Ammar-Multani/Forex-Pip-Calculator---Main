# iOS Build Preparation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to prepare your app for iOS building.

## 1. EAS Build Configuration

Updated `eas.json` with iOS build profiles:

- **Development**: For simulator testing
- **Preview**: For internal distribution to testers
- **Production**: For App Store submission

Added iOS-specific build parameters and configured submit options with placeholders for Apple credentials.

## 2. App Store Requirements

Updated `app.json` with:

- Proper iOS-specific configuration
- Required usage descriptions for permissions
- Privacy manifests for system APIs

## 3. Documentation Created

The following documents were created to help with iOS build and submission:

1. **IOS_BUILD_SETUP.md**: Detailed guide for setting up and building for iOS on a Mac
2. **IOS_APP_STORE_CHECKLIST.md**: Comprehensive checklist for App Store submission requirements
3. **IOS_USAGE_DESCRIPTIONS.md**: Guide for handling iOS permission usage descriptions

## 4. Next Steps

When you're ready to build for iOS (on a Mac):

1. Update Apple Developer account information in `eas.json`
2. Configure iOS certificates and provisioning profiles using `eas credentials`
3. Run the appropriate build command based on your needs:
   - `eas build --platform ios --profile development` (Simulator)
   - `eas build --platform ios --profile preview` (TestFlight)
   - `eas build --platform ios --profile production` (App Store)

## 5. Platform-Specific Code

Your app already includes platform-specific code (using `Platform.OS === 'ios'` checks), which will ensure proper rendering on iOS devices.

## 6. App Store Submission

Follow the **IOS_APP_STORE_CHECKLIST.md** guide when preparing your app for submission to ensure you've covered all Apple's requirements.

## 7. Privacy Considerations

Added privacy manifests for required system APIs and included standard usage descriptions for permissions. Update these with specific descriptions if your app actually uses any of these features.

---

All these changes have prepared your app for iOS building without requiring a Mac at this stage. When you're ready to proceed with actual iOS building and submission, you'll need access to a Mac with Xcode installed.
