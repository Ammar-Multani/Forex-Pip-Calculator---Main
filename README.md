## Key Functionality

### Pip Value Calculation

The app calculates pip values using the following formulas:

1. Pip Value in Quote Currency = Pip Size Ã— Position Size
2. Pip Value in Account Currency = Pip Value in Quote Currency Ã— Exchange Rate

Where:

- Pip Size is typically 0.0001 for most pairs (0.01 for JPY pairs)
- Position Size is determined by the selected lot type and count
- Exchange Rate is the current rate between the quote currency and account currency

### Lot Sizes

The app supports various standard lot sizes:

- Standard: 100,000 units
- Mini: 10,000 units
- Micro: 1,000 units
- Nano: 100 units
- Custom: User-defined units

## Technologies Used

- React Native / Expo for cross-platform mobile development
- TypeScript for type-safe code
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- React Navigation for screen navigation
- Expo Vector Icons for UI icons
- React Native Paper for UI components

## API Integration

The app uses exchange rate APIs to fetch current currency conversion rates for accurate pip value calculations.
